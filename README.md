# HardwareInfo

**PROJECT THAT MADE ME HATE C++***

## Overview

HardwareInfo is a comprehensive project that collects and displays detailed information about your computer's hardware components, such as the CPU, GPU, memory, disk, and motherboard. The information is gathered using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and DirectX.

## Features

- Retrieve CPU information
- Retrieve GPU information
- Retrieve memory information
- Retrieve disk information
- Retrieve motherboard information

## Challenges

This project was quite complex and involved a deep understanding of Windows APIs and COM interfaces. It required careful handling of various system resources and a thorough debugging process to ensure reliable and accurate information retrieval.

## Future Plans

If this repository reaches 5 stars, I will undertake the challenge of rewriting this project in assembly language! This will not only be a test of low-level programming skills but also a way to explore the hardware interactions in even greater detail.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- Visual Studio (recommended) or any other C++ compiler that supports Windows APIs

### Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AgustinCode/HardwareInfo.git
    ```
2. Open the `HardwareInfo.sln` file in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution.
4. Run the executable.
